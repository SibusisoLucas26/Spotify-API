Spotify API Credentials

The application uses the Spotify API for authentication and data retrieval. The credentials are stored in the app.py file:

    Client ID: a56ebd7094f445089d78603709c02422
    Client Secret: 315e9b113f3a468d93ab42f9f4bde493
    Redirect URI: http://localhost:8888/callback/

Authorization Flow

The app uses the client credentials flow to obtain an access token for making requests to the Spotify API.
Note

    This is a basic example and may require additional error handling, security measures, and improvements for production use.
    Make sure to secure your credentials and avoid hardcoding them in a production environment.
